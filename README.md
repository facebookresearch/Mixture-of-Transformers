## Key Results
**Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT)** adopts **modality-aware sparsity** in every non-embedding transformer layer (e.g., feed-forward networks, attention matrices, and layer normalization).
- âœ… **Chameleon setting (text + image generation):**
  MoT (7B) matches dense baseline quality using just **55.8% of the FLOPs**.

- âœ… **Chameleon setting (text + image + speech generation):**
  MoT (443M) achieves dense-level speech quality with only **37.2% of the FLOPs**.

- âœ… **Transfusion setting (text autoregressive + image diffusion generation):**
  MoT (7B) matches dense model quality using **one-third of the FLOPs**.

- âœ… **System profiling:**
  MoT (Chameleon setting, 443M) achieves:
  - Dense-level image quality in **47%** of the wall-clock time.
  - Dense-level text quality in **75.6%** of the wall-clock time.
  **(Measured on AWS `p4de.24xlarge` instances with NVIDIA A100 GPUs.)**

ðŸ’¬ Modality-aware sparsity in MoT offers an effective path to native generation of a growing number of modalities, from text and images to speech and beyond.

## Tutorial: Step-by-step implementation of MoT

ðŸ’¬ Let's dive in!

---

### **Prerequisite: Your Own Transformer Model**

To implement MoT, start with a basic transformer model implement. Hereâ€™s a simplified example:

```python
class FeedForward(torch.nn.Module):
    ...

class Attention(torch.nn.Module):
    ...

class TransformerBlock(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, args):
        super().__init__()
        self.attention = Attention(args)
        self.feed_forward = FeedForward(args)

    def forward(self, x, *args):
        x = x + self.attention(x, *args)
        return x + self.feed_forward(x, *args)

class Transformer(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, args):
        super().__init__()
        self.layers = nn.ModuleList([TransformerBlock(args) for _ in range(args.n_layers)])

    def forward(self, x, *args):
        for layer in self.layers:
            x = layer(x, *args)
        return x

```

### **Step 1: Modality-Specific Feed-Forward Networks**

The `ModalityUntiedFeedForward` class enhances the feed-forward network by creating separate experts for each modality, enabling specialized processing for tasks involving multiple modalities, such as text, image, or speech.

#### **Key Features**
1. **Decoupled Parameters**: Each modality has its own feed-forward expert, instantiated using the existing `FeedForward` class for modularity and simplicity.
2. **Modality-Specific Routing**: Tokens are (deterministically) routed to modality-specific expert based on the `modality_masks`.
3. **Modality-Specific normalization**: Each modality expert applies its own normalization layer to ensure tailored processing.

ðŸ’¬ Congrats! you have done more than half (67%) of the job -- because `Feedforward` typically takes 67% of the non-embedding parameters of Transformer!


#### **Code**

```python
class ModalityUntiedFeedForward(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, args):
        super().__init__()
        self.n_modalities = args.n_modalities  # Number of modalities, e.g., 2 (text, image) or 3 (text, image, speech)

        # Initialize feed-forward experts for each modality
        self.local_experts = torch.nn.ModuleList([
            FeedForward(
                dim=args.dim,
                hidden_dim=int(args.ffn_exp * args.dim),
                dropout=args.ffn_dropout,
                ...
            ) for _ in range(self.n_modalities)
        ])

        # Initialize modality-specific normalization layers
        self.local_experts_ffn_norm = torch.nn.ModuleList([
            build_norm_fn(args.norm_type, args.dim, args.norm_eps, args.norm_affine)
            for _ in range(self.n_modalities)
        ])

    def forward(self, x, modality_masks):
        expert_outputs = []

        # Process tokens for each modality separately
        for i in range(self.n_modalities):
            expert_input = x[modality_masks[i]]  # Select tokens for this modality
            expert_output = self.local_experts[i](expert_input)  # Feed-forward processing
            expert_output = self.local_experts_ffn_norm[i](expert_output)  # Normalization
            expert_outputs.append(expert_output)

        # Merge modality-specific outputs into a unified tensor
        merged_output = torch.empty_like(x)
        for i in range(self.n_modalities):
            merged_output[modality_masks[i]] = expert_outputs[i]

        return merged_output
```

#### **Example of `modality_masks`**
In the snippet above, we use `modality_masks`, a list of binary masks to identify which tokens belong to each modality.
  ```
  [[True, False, True, False],  # Text
   [False, True, False, False], # Image
   [False, False, False, True]] # Speech
  ```
Tokens are routed to the corresponding modality-specific expert according to the modality mask.


---

### **Step 2: Modality-Specific Attention Class**

The `ModalityUntiedAttention` class extends the standard transformer attention mechanism by introducing modality-specific weight matrices for queries (`wq`), keys (`wk`), values (`wv`), and output projections (`wo`). It also incorporates modality-specific normalization layers to ensure that the model can handle modality-specific representations more effectively.

---

#### **Key Features**
1. **Decoupled Parameters**: Separate parameters (`wq`, `wk`, `wv`, `wo`) for each modality to capture modality-specific relationships.
2. **Modality-Specific Normalization**: Norm layers for each modality applied to intermediate results (`q`, `k`, `v`) and final attention outputs.
3. **Modality-Specific Routing**: Tokens are (deterministically) routed to modality-specific attention experts using `modality_masks`.
4. **Global Attention**: After the QKV projection, global attention is applied over all tokens in the sequence.

```
ðŸ’¬ To summarize the code flow:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Modality-specific projections (`wq`, `wk`, `wv`, `wo`) and norm layers are created for each modality.
2. **QKV Projection and Normalization**:
   - Tokens are routed to modality-specific `wq`, `wk`, `wv` and QK-norm experts using `modality_masks`.
   - The modality-specific queries, keys, and values are restored into their original sequence order.
3. **Attention Computation**:
   - Global self-attention is computed.
4. **Output Projection and Normalization**:
   - The self-attention outputs pass through modality-specific `wo` and norm layers
   - The modality-specific attention output vectors are restored into their original sequence order as the final module output.

Please refer to [`src/simple_ModalityUntiedAttention.py`](src/simple_ModalityUntiedAttention.py) for the complete implementation.

### **Step 3: Handling Norms**
ðŸ’¬ Here are some special tips on how to handle implementation of the norms.

If your `TransformerBlock` already handles normalization within the attention and feed-forward classes, you're all set:

```python
class TransformerBlock(torch.nn.Module):
    def forward(self, x):
        h = x + self.attention(x)
        out = h + self.feed_forward(h)
        return out
```

If not, we recommend moving normalization into the respective attention and feed-forward classes, as shown in the implementations above.

---

### **Bringing It All Together**

By combining `ModalityUntiedFeedForward` and `ModalityUntiedAttention`, MoT introduces modality-specific specialization where each modality adopts a completely separate set of transformer parameters. Interaction across modalities is enabled via global self-attention at each layer.

**These modular extensions integrate seamlessly into existing transformer architectures**, offering efficient and scalable solutions for multi-modal tasks.

ðŸ’¬ Excited to try it out? We're looking forward to hearing your experience applying MoT to your own multimodal LLM project! ðŸš€
